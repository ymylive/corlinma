"""Tests for :mod:`corlinman_server.gateway.lifecycle.starter_skills`.

Covers the first-boot starter-SKILL.md bundle that lets a freshly-
installed gateway boot with a working library of procedural skills
("plan", "test-driven-development", "deep-research", …) under the
default profile's ``skills/`` directory without operator copy-paste.

Tests assert:

* :func:`bundled_skills_root` resolves the in-wheel package data when
  no env override is set.
* :func:`seed_starter_skills` copies every bundled ``*.md`` into an
  empty target on first call and is idempotent on the second call
  (existing files are left in place, not overwritten).
* Pre-existing skill files in the target are listed under ``skipped``
  and their bodies are preserved — operator edits stick across reboots.
* ``CORLINMAN_BUNDLED_SKILLS_DIR`` env override takes precedence; a
  pointing-at-nothing override falls back to the packaged bundle so
  boot never silently runs with an empty registry.
* Missing source (env override pointing nowhere AND package data
  absent) returns a no-op report instead of raising — degraded boot
  is acceptable, crashing is not.
