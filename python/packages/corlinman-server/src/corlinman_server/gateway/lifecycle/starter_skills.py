"""First-boot starter-skill seeding.

A freshly-installed corlinman gateway has no skills in
``<data_dir>/profiles/default/skills/`` — the registry would be empty
and the agent would have no documented procedural knowledge to lean
on. To make the out-of-the-box experience hermes-like ("configure one
model, everything else just works"), the gateway ships a curated
bundle of starter ``SKILL.md`` files under
:mod:`corlinman_server.bundled_skills` and copies them into the default
profile's skills directory the first time the profile is created.

The bundle source is resolved in this order:

1. ``CORLINMAN_BUNDLED_SKILLS_DIR`` environment variable — full
   override, lets operators ship a private starter set without
   forking the package.
2. ``importlib.resources.files("corlinman_server.bundled_skills")`` —
   the in-wheel location, the normal case for installed deployments.

If neither resolves to an existing directory, seeding is a quiet
no-op (the gateway still boots; the operator can drop SKILL.md files
into the profile manually).

The copy step is **idempotent**: any ``*.md`` already present in the
target directory wins. That way an operator who hand-edited
``MEMORY.md`` worth of skill body never has it silently overwritten on
the next boot.
