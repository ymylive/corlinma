"""``corlinman_server.gateway.services`` — gateway-internal service layer.

Mirrors :rust:`corlinman_gateway::services`. These services expose the
chat pipeline as callable Python APIs so other in-process components
(channel adapters, scheduler jobs, admin tasks) can drive it without a
round-trip through HTTP.

``bootstrap`` is the sibling-seam hook the gateway lifespan calls (see
``docs/contracts/runtime-wiring.md`` §2): it wires the ChatService onto
``AppState.chat`` (P2 direct backend or P4 gRPC-agent backend, picked
per config) and then launches the P3 channel runtime, handing its
background tasks back to the lifespan for cancellation on shutdown.
